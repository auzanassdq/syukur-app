# Syukur App

**A Platform for Anonymous Gratitude Sharing**

Many people focus on problems rather than appreciating life’s blessings. Inspired by this issue, I created **Syukur App**, a platform for anonymously expressing gratitude, fostering positivity, and shifting focus from complaints to thankfulness.

### **How It Works**
Users can post anonymous gratitude messages and read others’ reflections, creating a space for shared positivity. By engaging with these messages, users gain perspective and develop a habit of thankfulness.

### **Technology Stack**
- **Next.js** – Fast, smooth user experience.
- **ShadCN** – Clean, modern UI.
- **Supabase** – Real-time database.
- **Clerk** – Secure, anonymous authentication.

### **Impact and Future Plans**
Syukur App aims to promote a culture of gratitude, inspiring users to appreciate life more. Future updates may include personal gratitude journals, themed challenges, and optional social sharing. 

By encouraging gratitude, Syukur App helps create a more positive and appreciative community, one post at a time.
